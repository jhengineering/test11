                <p>
                    <br>Systems engineer with more than 20 years of experience in technical and infrastructure
                    areas linked to operations management and technology resource management teams. I have worked in
                    IT and networks, coordination in operational areas and software training. In addition, I have
                    worked in design of technological solutions in the area of Smart Home and Smart Building automation,
                    certification and analysis of networks, channeling, structured cabling and fiber optics.
                    Ensuring IoT interconnections.</br>

                    <br>As Project Engineer and Estimator, I have led automation projects of electronic security
                    equipment, including infrastructure, design and migration of installed bases, service to
                    suppliers and monitoring of projects in various sectors, such as industry, banks, newspapers, hotels,
                    hospitals, universities and schools, data center and private homes.</br>

                    <br>In software design, I have collaborated with programmers for HMIWEB type projects taking
                    digital signals to interact with equipment in the field and display their status in operator
                    consoles, such as HVAC, Fire Panels, CCTV and Access Control.</br>
                    <br>In the development area, I have knowledge in Python, HTML and CSS. With which I have done small
                    projects.</br>

                            <p>As a project engineer and manager, I have worked in fields related to technology,
                                telecommunications and electronic security. I have applied technical skills such as
                                planning, estimating, networking, fiber optic and low voltage cabling, customer
                                relations, presentations, feasibility assessment, financial estimating, human resources
                                and technical. I have worked on projects from the beginning in clean construction with
                                AutoCAD drawings, performing the necessary evaluations with contractors for the

                            <h2>Automation</h2>
                            <p>Intelligent building automation is a growing trend in the construction sector. The
                                interconnection of equipment and devices through networks and the Internet of Things
                                (IoT) enables more efficient and effective management of a building's resources and
                                services. I offer ideas for the automation of intelligent buildings, homes and
                                industrial establishments interconnected through networks and the Internet of Things. In
                                addition, I have created simple programs in Python for the operation of small systems
                                such as barcodes and QR codes. I also offer small web page designs for companies or
                                personnel that require it.

                            <p>Infrastructure security is crucial to protect critical systems and assets against
                                physical and cyber threats. I have worked with servers from brands such as Hewlett
                                Packard, Dell and Huawei with operating systems from Windows Server 2003 to Windows
                                Server 2016. In addition, I have worked with virtualization technologies such as
                                Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware and Oracle VirtualBox. I have performed information migration
                                projects and system upgrades based on vendor software such as Honeywell Enterprise
                                Building Integrator (EBI). I have also installed CCTV cameras and access control systems
                                from Honeywell Digital Video Manager (DVM), Axis, Dahua and Hikvision. I have worked on
                                structured cabling networks with Hubbell and Panduit, Cisco and Hewlett Packard
                                switches, floor and wall racks. I provide adequate trucking plans and detailed
